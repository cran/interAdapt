<h4> About <i>interAdapt</i> </h4>

<p><i> A tool created by Aaron Fisher, Harris Jaffee, and Michael Rosenblum </i></p>

<p>
When designing a clinical trial, study coordinators often have prior evidence that the treatment might work better in a one subpopulation than another. <!--Recruiting from both subpopulations in these scenarios can improve the generalizability of the trial’s results and increase the patient recruitment rate, but will lower the trial’s power to detect an effect if only one subpopulation truly benefits.--> One strategy in these scenarios is to conduct a trial with an adaptive enrollment criteria, where we decide whether or not to continue enrolling patients from each subpopulation based on interim analyses of whether each subpopulation is benefiting. In order for the type I error and the power of the trial to be calculable, the decision rules for changing enrollment must be set before the trial starts.

<i>interAdapt</i> is a tool for generating pre-determined decision rules for trials with adaptive enrollement criteria. Using this application, you can also compare the performance of the resulting adaptive trial designs to the performance of standard designs with fixed enrollment criteria. Performance is compared in terms of power, expected sample size, and expected trial duration. The family-wise type I error rate set to be constant for all trials compared. <i>interAdapt</i> requires that the user's default web browser to be either <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/' target="_blank">Firefox</a> or <a href='https://www.google.com/chrome' target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>.
